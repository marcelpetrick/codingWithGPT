# prompt used with GPT-4 to generate the islands
```
Create me text output with X and _ as only characters (and some line wrapping of course). I want a 20 by 20 matrix with just one blob of X which form one island.
Each line should have at least 20 characters.
Put the output please into code block. so that the browser does not format it weirdly.
