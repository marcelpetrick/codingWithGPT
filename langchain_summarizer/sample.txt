hey everyone David Shapiro here with another podcast interview today I am
super excited to introduce Anna Bernstein one of the world's first uh professional prompt engineers
Anna is wonderful to talk to very very bright um and just a wonderful charismatic
person and so uh without further Ado um Anna would you like to tell us a little
bit about yourself your history how you got to where you are and what you're working on
um yeah I uh am a prompt engineer at copy AI
um kind of a strange path to get there um but uh I yeah create the prompt
infrastructure uh at copy Ai and it's a bit of a it's both a building role for things we
need and a bit of a mad scientist role for things that might be possible um which is a lot of fun
um and uh I grew up in New York come from a very non-tech background until I
started at this role um so like I said it's been kind of kind of a strange path to get here but I um I
love it I love performance engineering and I love where I am in the industry so
excellent thanks so much yeah so during our our original
Annas love of language
um like pre-podcast talk one of the things that you mentioned was that you always had a love of language and I
don't remember exactly how you how you articulated it but that you really love to zoom in and get into the weeds of
language so I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your background and and your love of language
because that really stood out to me yeah um I mean I've always wanted to be a
writer um and uh I think I have sort of a slightly
obsessive approach to language um which can be a good or a bad thing uh
certainly not the best when you're trying to figure out the words to choose on a podcast
um but I really like taking an analytical approach to language but specifically to like creative language
creative writing literary work um I think uh it it can be really
fruitful to like drill down on that um and that's manifested in a couple
ways before this job um the first um was uh I don't know if you want me to
go into this yet sort of education and stuff or or uh yeah please go for it yeah we'll
Annas love of Arabic
we'll jump around just as it makes sense so um I was uh I had a minor uh I was doing
a minor in Arabic uh translation specifically like fusa translation which is a lot of um
medieval poetry as well as the Quran and the youth and I
um really loved how compact the grammar was in a way it wasn't flowery it was extremely
efficient and extremely elaborate at the same time and you know a forward
sentence since could be like you know an eight-word sentence or much longer in
English um but it was a lot of puzzle solving in
regards to language and a lot of like like a single diacritic Mark could like change the entire meaning of a sentence
so you really had to be extremely precise and at the same time the puzzles you were unlocking weren't dry they were
like these beautiful verses and once you got it right once you had all the like you know oh this is an adjustment or
whatever and you like unlocked the puzzle of that verse you were rewarded with like oh my God that meaning is
beautiful so it was this like combination of like analytical
um like approach to it and like puzzle solving approach that like ultimately the puzzle you were
solving was like a beautiful poetic meaning um and that I moved on from uh College
thinking that would never be relevant ever to my career
um but I kind of find that that's there's a parallel area to prompt
engineering for sure yeah that's that's such a wonderful story and my my fiance is a uh she loves
How Anna landed her job
Latin and so she tells me all very similar stories about translating The Aeneid
um and just uh it's it's fascinating because especially for for
monolinguists like myself um or mono Globs probably is the right word
um like we're only familiar with English so I have I have a bunch of different directions I want to go
um but I guess first well actually let's let's rewind because
this was a really great intro so let's rewind a minute and tell tell us a little bit about how you how you landed
this job it started at a jazz club right
um yeah I um love going out to a jazz club when it's raining and just having a single
drink by myself and it's a wonderful like ritual that I do maybe once a month and
um I did that um went to go check out a new place um and started talking to someone there
um who was uh one year Zhang who's um who was an early person at copy AI
um and we had this moment where our it was like oh your brain does a
really similar thing to what my brain is doing like we just sort of got along really well
um and uh you know kept hanging out and there was a moment where
he was trying to figure out this was like the second or third time we hung out he was trying to figure out what the
um I'm not forgetting the name of it but there's there's a word in uh there's an
Indonesian word for a certain type of flavor it's similar to a mommy but it's specifically Indonesian
now I don't remember what it is and I would mispronounce it anyway but basically he was like oh I can't think
of it um hold on and he pulled up his phone and started doing something this was
summer of 2021. well I just want to start doing something and I was like what what is that
um and it was the playground for gp3 um on his phone and he was he had like
typed in stuff of like describing the flavor and then like asking what it was
um and he like explained to me what he was doing and what the playground was gp3 and I find this was early so this is
like Da Vinci just based Da Vinci um and I was immediately like oh wait I think maybe if we just just wrote the
first part of the sentence instead rather than asking the question out right it would just like autocomplete or
like I don't know I just like very arrogantly immediately had a billion ideas for how to do this thing that I barely understood
um and we got the flavored name and uh it was kind of hooked
and you know a little while after that he was like why don't you um you know we've tried a lot of people in this role
we're not even sure if this is a role at the time they were like oh you just sort of improve the examples in our case
shots or whatever um it's more of a copywriting role like that and like they were but they had
tried a number of people in that role um and it it kind of wasn't working so they
were really taking a shot in the dark with someone when you met at a jazz club
um and uh I remember Chris Chris Lou who's one of the co-founders of cop AI
when he was explaining it to me I loved the way he explained it he was like it's kind of like a spell like you know in
Harry Potter when they say a spell slightly wrong and it like does the slightly wrong thing but they have to like get the flick of the wrist right
and like you just have to like get the spell right but you don't know what this you're inventing the spell
and I was like that's that I can do that so um yeah it started there on on contract
freelance and then um when if I was adding value they hired me so yeah
wonderful that is such a great story that's like a perfect origin story
Annas background
um so yeah so you mentioned that you you work on the prompt infrastructure for
copy Ai and obviously we want to respect um you know any proprietary information
but since you since you've been there and and you know you work on language and you've had this really analytical
View and it sounds like you almost kind of had an intuitive um kind of take to it
um so I have I have a couple couple directions that I want to go there's one could you could you describe you know
how your background your study of of Arabic or anything that you might have done before then because I believe you
mentioned that you um you did a you were a research assistant before that as well
um but then how does all that tie into prompt engineering and obviously like if
they've hired you full time it has worked out well so what about about you your experience your interests has um
made like made you ideal for this role I know I asked a bunch of questions so just I'll leave it up to you pick
whichever direction you want to go first yeah well I think um it's so much what I
was saying about you know this sort of like analytical approach to what makes language beautiful or what makes language compelling thinking about the
like specifics of when you look at the language itself but also like the audience's interaction with language
that makes it compelling but I uh can't say it was necessarily all of
my I mean I had a wonderful education in New York um and then uh had a great two years of
education at McAllister in Minnesota and then dropped out
um because of health issues I I couldn't get to class every day um went back to New York and
um worked partly as a copywriter but as you mentioned partly as a um like research assistant mainly for
like historical and biographical projects um I worked on a book called women who
made New York with Julie scofo where I um got to research a lot of different women and that was that was really uh
wonderful and fascinating digging up like the exact right fact about someone that sort of unlocked their whole narrative
which I guess when I as I say that that sort of fits with this theme that I'm realizing of like the sort of like
slight obsessiveness and like finding just the right thing
for like a narrative or creative um purpose
um I also um write poetry which I was the other day I was at a party my friend was like
here is poetess anniversity and I was like never introduce me that way again
um but I yeah I have some some poetry in journals
um and uh a couple of short stories um but writing poetry is
up for me it's a it's obsessive process but it's also one that involves
seeing many different approaches at the same time and keeping them in mind and
often like mentally not throwing them away in case you go down one route and it doesn't work and then you have to
back up and go down a different route and often it's also a process of
choosing when to go with your first thought and when to go with your like
246 thought um it's rarely like your fifth thought I
find personally but um but I think like that sort of
um thinking of like what's the most intuitive thing to do here balanced with like what's an
unintuitive thing to do here that I haven't maybe thought of yet that would be a better way of approaching this
um I think is it's helpful along with obviously the editing process of poetry is so like granular and like you have to
and even short stories like there's this you know tip of like if you find yourself
um taking in and or taking out and putting in the same comma over and over again
your story is probably done otherwise it's probably not um so
it's it's yeah it kind of all all ties together in a way especially because
when you're writing you're trying to write for yourself but also write for
your audience and you're trying to think of how you're writing interacts with another brain or a potential other brain or
potentially many other brains but you're also trying not to think about that as well but it's
but you you have to be thinking about that and with the with prompt engineering there's this balance of
treating the AI as human in a weird way where you're like what
how would a human do this what parts of the human thought process process am I missing when I analyze this task like
what what is missing from this task in this sort of undercurrent of it that isn't being provided to the AI
um and sometimes that's better with like treating it as more human but then there are also ways where you're like
I am treating it as too human and I need to like back up and think of like the specific limitations and the specific
powers that it has and that each different model has so that was very rambling I'm sorry
Language models
well I uh I have good news I was able to follow it but I think I think that
there's I mean gosh there's so much that I agree with you on because you know I've been uh slightly obsessed myself
with language models um you know and uh so yeah you mentioned
a few things a couple times that I want to um unpack a little bit so one was
audience so you've mentioned audience a couple times like you know what it think
thinking about the language model as your potential audience you know maybe it's maybe it helps to think about it as
human or or not depending on um so there's there's that aspect
um but you've also talked about how you you tend to think through like you know
the the undercurrents of what is and is not present in the language that you're feeding the model or the prompt
engineering but one thing that really stood out to me the thing that most stood out to me um as you were sharing that was the
process of right fighting poetry and you said that like you know sometimes
there's the intuitive path there's the unintuitive path sometimes you pay attention to the first thing and
sometimes it's the 200th thing um and that sounds kind of like prompt Engineering in some
respects and so what I wanted to to do was explore this idea that creative
writing or poetry in particular which is a very uh specific use of language
um how how your your your mental approaches to this how that might
have played into your abilities as a prompt engineer what your observations are and then finally
um you know editing if that kind of figures into it as a skill I want to think about these things as skills that
have been developed or intuitions that have been developed so what are what are your uh associations there with poetry
and audience yeah I think choosing the exact right
Word choice
word um is in order to elicit the right reaction is extremely
important and I actually don't even know which one I'm talking about when I say that because I mean it for both
um and elicit the right reaction although means
very different things for both those those things and one it's you know you're almost trying to
by finding the exact right word in the prompt like almost task locate
for the right reaction from the AI and I think people under utilize word choice
in their prompts they sort of rely on approach which is good to take a variety of approaches that's also very good but
sometimes I find that an approach I want to take doesn't work on the first try or
like the 10th try with the wording I'm trying like sometimes it is really helpful like you can make this crazy
approach that you thought just you know wasn't viable work when you like really hit the right
like vocabulary for it um like there's a specific I won't go into too much detail but there's a
specific approach that way that I was like oh it doesn't work it doesn't work and like no matter the synonyms I try to and then I you know on this phrase
thoroughly and faithfully and that like unlock the whole thing um and the same thing can happen with
poetry I mean instead of the right generation happening what you're looking for is that like kick in the chest when
you read it which is a bit more ephemeral and whatever but
um but you know for me it does feel in some ways like a binary when I read
poetry like either that happens for me or it doesn't um so yeah I think a lot of it comes back
to language as act and you know language of speech act and that kind of thing and
this is like a very like prompt engineering is a very literal like concrete
example of like language as like a speech act like a like a piece of speech
that by being spoken and acts something um so I think they both belong to that
category um that's maybe a little more like I don't know maybe you're looking for
something a little more practical I think word choice and I think in poetry something that's also underutilized this
variety of approach when it comes to like I know I I need to use that more when I when it's when something's not
working I've gone down a pathway for a while to like go back and like think about the whole like approach of the
poem rather than like line by line necessarily um or the wording of lines and that does
happen with prompt engineering as well where you realize you have over engineered something and the approach
just isn't working and you need to like take a step back from it so there's a lot of parallels there
absolutely one of the Cardinal rules that I have learned is uh more often
Locking vs unlocking
than not less is more sometimes if you're really struggling with a prompt it's just like just simplify it and see what happens
um so one of the one another uh phrase that you've that you've used kind of
differently um when you were describing um like working through uh or getting
getting the right effect from creative writing and another and you use this word again or this these pair of words
for um for getting the prompt getting the machine to do what you wanted to do is
locking versus unlocking trying to unlock whether it's a particular response from a person from a reader or
trying to to get that that feeling for yourself or then of course getting the performance from the machine so that's a
very particular choice of words and it resonates with me but I wanted to ask you what what do you mean when you use
that that um I don't know if it's an analogy but the the adjectives of of locked versus unlocked like it's almost
like you're trying to pull something out of the machine right just like you're trying to pull something out of a reader
or yourself yeah yeah it's similar to that you know that the thing you're trying to say the
emotion is almost a strange word for it it's been wrong but let's say the emotion you're trying to get at is
somewhere within yourself also I mean you're your primary reader as you're writing poetry so you're trying to like
create that feeling for yourself too um and you know it's somewhere
in the big jumble of all the words that could ever exist and you're trying to
find the right ones um in order to yeah unlock it or it would be like find it
um and when you're working with the AI you're working with sort of a toddler
that knows everything um but also when you're writing poetry
you're like thinking about how you're writing for like every one and not everyone in the world but like uh you're
not writing typically for one person you're writing for like an audience of brains so it's actually not that dissimilar in
a weird way where you're like this is it doesn't have to like unlock or task
locate or however we want to put it that response in every single person as long as it like tasks locates for it in the
people to for whom that emotion exists and or like
that particular connection exists of experience um or of enjoying your poetry or
whatever that sentence got the hell away from me but uh yeah it's it's
the more I like think about parallels the more it does come back to like past location of
emotion for poetry um which is kind of strange I hadn't
thought about it that way before excellent excellent yeah so you you mentioned task locating a few times and
Task locating
um my my fiance is a librarian uh by training and so she's she's uh shared that term with me but from from your
perspective could you share with our audience um what what it is that you mean by task locating
um as it pertains to prompt engineering you know with with large language models but also with human audiences and you
know you've you've talked a lot about audience and and alluded to like theory of mind like you you uh model what's
going on in the mind of either the machine or your audience of one your audience of yourself or audience of many
many brains so talk to us a little bit about task locating what what is that
um task locating is essentially tricking the AI no it's um finding uh for for if
what you wanted to generate typically exists within a specific context it's recreating that context for it so that
it is more likely to generate the thing you want um you know like if you
wanted to generate a name for whatever reason you weren't just
doing this in a similar way you could be like you know paper like paper title bye
and then it would generate a name even though you haven't told it to generate a name so that's like a very simple like
example of task okay location but the idea of it crops up in a lot of other ways you can sort of like
a lot of it gets fuzzy was also sort of like priming the model in different ways
um and it also intersects I think with um like I'm not totally sure what the industry
term is for this right now but it tends to instead to change ground but like irregular K shots where the example is
actually of a different cast um but even with regular kit you you are
kind of task locating for like um you know here's this example here's this example here's this example you're
like trying to convince it that somewhere within it exists
a list of the perfect examples that you need um
so yeah there's I guess there's like concrete task location of like things that actually exist in its Corpus and
then there's a bit of deceptive task location for like things that you're trying to tell it exists
um but uh of a common way to sort of test locate a
prime is um through like author voice you know you see it all the I mean it's
in every it's like you know you are Dan you are uh even like people tell like
you are a sentient AI that's really good at stuff like helps and it's it's
um that's a form of task location in my opinion the author voice thing
Agent model
yeah I um in one of my books I called that uh agent model so like you tell it like this is what you are and this is
what you're capable of and it's able to just kind of step into those shoes and say oh this is what I am and and like
you said how did you say you said like kind of tricking the AI or or kind of getting it to confabulate into this
latent space that it's got that's wonderful um I'm glad to know that another human thinks about this the way that I do it's
very reassuring um because I've tried to explain some of this to folks and they and and some some
people don't get it because one thing that I have found is that um
computer science people sometimes think of it as a machine learning model first but you and I we we
seem to think of it as a as a language instrument first I I don't want to put
words in your mouth do you do you agree with that do you think of this as primarily um what did you call it earlier a speech
act right like you don't do you think of it as a machine or do you think of it otherwise
I definitely still think of it as a machine um you know it's um
the there have been Concepts over the past however long it's been year and
year and a half hour long where I've um learned more about the sort of like
not even broad concepts of machine learning because a lot of them are specific but sort of from a non-technic
like this lever does this it works this way and like that helps I find a lot in
explaining a lot of its behavior um but then there are also things I end up explaining to
the people who make them where it's like will it acts this way and I think it's because of this or like have you noticed
this Behavior where it is like inevitably getting away from them a little bit like you can't predict all of
its Behavior via the technical side of machine learning that's almost the point of it
um so it is like I mean it's a sign that the the technical side of it has been very
successful that we are now like thinking of it in a non-technical way
yeah that that makes total sense um especially
kind of the way that you just articulated that that at the end like it it is a sign of success that
it's kind of gotten away from from Strictly the engineering side or the or the scientific or technical side by
virtue of the fact that it is working because it is not uh explicitly like maybe deterministic or fully mechanistic
um so what I wanted to to explore a little bit more on this uh line of
reasoning or or thinking was how does so you said that you do think of it kind
of as a machine and you try and you know observe its behaviors and and establish reasons for the behaviors or or at least
explanations a model for the behavior um but how does how does language overlay or intersect
with that because you know at the beginning of the conversation you mentioned all kinds of um aspects of
language Arabic language you know diacritics and and grammar and everything so based on your use of large
language models how much does how much does do aspects of language such as you
mentioned you know vocabulary word choice different approaches um but what about what about grammar and
syntax and other aspects of language how do you perceive those as having been woven into into the machine
um so to speak not totally sure I understand the question I'm sorry
that's fine I probably didn't ask that well um okay so asking it another way
um here let's do some human prompt engineering um so the prompt that I just gave you didn't work so let me try a
different prompt um so word choice is very important for prompt engineering
right how how important is grammar or syndrome oh I see okay yeah
um yeah I mean you're the way you choose to phrase
something the style of syntaxis can also like can
indicate a level of sophistication of writing versus the Simplicity of writing
and maybe you want that Simplicity of writing you want direct uh you know simple cause and effects
informational writing for your readers or maybe you want it to be a bit more human sounding or literary and that
the style of I find like rhythm
um especially with example following models the the style of the the Rhythm of the sentence and having a
you know a classic sort of writing world having like a variety of rhythms in your sentences
um variety of number of Clauses in your sentences um tends to make a Threading I find more
sophisticated um they're also you know things like creating links when you want it to do a
task like creating links um via the verbs you use where you can
use causative verbs rather than linking things um
with uh like just like being like you have a bunch of briefs and a bunch
of these things or like like a bunch of briefs and a bunch of pieces of content
you can actually link those positively rather than just kind of putting them near each other in the sentence
um there's also like this isn't quite great but when it
comes to word choice there's like approaches where sometimes referring to something in different places
with synonyms if you can refer to it multiple times throughout the prompts um like referring to it with synonyms
each time can help the model sort of triangulate on what it is um but if you're using that section as
sort of a tool for another section you want to refer back to that section you really need parity between what you call
it what you label it and what you call it in the sentence you can't like approximate it the way you would with a human being necessarily or it won't work
as well um so this is like structurally there's a lot of stuff there's also the whole like
approach I'm sure that of like you can put things in the future tense the
present tense the past tense you can say you've already written this explain to me how you did it you can
do a lot of weird stuff um with yeah just uh with tents
especially I find that can really switch up abilities
AI is a toddler
yeah absolutely um especially by making those positive assertions it just kind of rolls with it
and says okay sure like you told me this thing is true so I'll just assume that that's true or at least that seems to be
how it interprets um that one thing that you said earlier um that I I wanted to unpack before we
we take a brief break and then come back to to change to change gears was you
said that uh that this kind of AI is like a toddler that knows everything and I thought that that was uh very uh
illustrative um but I like that and I wanted I was wondering if you could unpack how you how you came to that understanding of
large language models um I mean it's a little trite it's not
like totally true but it's like you know it's close enough it's how I describe it uh at parties when I'm trying to
describe my job um but yeah it it's
I mean it it has a huge wealth of knowledge and also often not a lot of common sense
although obviously that's getting better all the time um but it doesn't you know have common
sense the way a human being has Common Sense where when we're in an interaction with another person we
are thinking there's like a tent we put out this is going to be confusing genetically
there's a tent we put over the interaction I feel like of like the other person's
intent what they want out of the conversation like especially if we're like trying to do
something for them obviously it's like what is the goal um and it doesn't always
sometimes it doesn't have the tent over what it's doing and sometimes it puts the tent up over here or like just or
it's upside down or like whatever it it's not always as good as that as a human being is
um where you're like you kind of did this you did what you thought you were doing well
but but a human being would understand that that's not and that's what I like when I'm editing other people's prompts so much
of what I'm doing is going back into the prompt and going this you didn't even say like what you thought like what like you're you're telling me
out loud what you want and that's not what you told the AI you told it to do something totally different and it's like or something like a little bit off
and it's taking you very literally and doing that thing rather than doing what a human would do and like understanding
the overall task um and that reminds me of being a child I didn't know what was going on I I
definitely remember I probably still have moments like that but that definitely reminds me of
uh you know being yeah literally being a toddler and like not um
understanding often dynamics of situations I was in
except they didn't have like all the details of the War of 1812 or whatever in my brain
AI in 2023
yeah absolutely um that was that's such a great uh way
to elucidate that um okay so we're going to take a quick break obviously for the audience it'll
be instantaneous but we'll be right back and we will um we'll change focus on to a little bit a little bit other uh
aspects of language and language models and where AI is going so we'll be back
in just a moment hey everybody and we're back from our
short break um so uh wanted to change gears for the last uh section of this episode
um uh as as the audience uh may or may not know uh one of the key things that I
want to do with this podcast is to demystify AI for 2023 and for the world
because things are changing so incredibly quickly and that's why I'm having these interviews with people who
are at The Cutting Edge um or who have past experience to draw
from in order to help provide guidance and kind of shine some light on the
situation for the rest of us so um Anna I wanted to ask you where do you
see AI going particularly how are things going to change in 2023 what are your
thoughts on kind of the state of things and where it's going in the immediate future
pretty difficult question to answer um
I think uh as we see the writing quality itself of current
llms improve and get more human um there will probably be kind of a
parallel debate about um like people right now the debate for
writing is like will students generate essays with the AI and I think as the
writing quality gets better and better it'll move into will people when writing competitions
using bits and pieces maybe not hold up but like from the AI it's parallel to the debate that's going on with like
visual art um and AI visual art um and uh
I think I hope that that'll sort of
even itself out people will realize that um that's kind of
like how 3D printing didn't kill sculpture um it's I and I hope people embrace it
as a tool I think maybe that won't happen in 2023 but I do think that'll happen
um you know as just rather than thinking of it as competition thinking of it as like an augmentation like another brain
to think with but not a replacement for your brain um
and uh and I I mean I also think the nature of like search is going to change the
nature of like finding information is going to change as we get you know things like chat GPT which are you know
reliable um and sort of more conversational uh
like returners of information um that in a way have like a better idea
of like the tent that I was talking about earlier like how do I keep saying like the tent and that's so close to the
word intent which is really just what I mean but the like your overall intent that like I mean Google has poured so
much into intent of search and when you make it conversational and make it an AI like
chat gbt that it's able to do it really well so I think that's going to change I
know I've already used it that way I um was bored with the deli sandwiches I was
ordering my usual roster and whenever I searched a new type of deli sandwich or like deli sandwich comp best deli
whatever I tried to search it was like here's some great Jolly sandwiches to make at home and I was like that's not
helpful and it's not like I need like a for like a New York Deli like what's a
good combination um and I use chat GPT for it and it gave me a slightly weird but pretty good
sandwich I don't remember what was in it but it was pretty delicious anyway so my point is I think the nature of search is
going to change and I hope that the nature or how people think about like creative augmentation is Gonna Change
What are you worried about
that's that's that's a phenomenal View and and I am right there with you in terms of one just hoping for people to
embrace it and and thinking of it as an augmentation not a replacement something that helps make our lives you know
better easier whatever um that's a great idea using it for uh coming up with a better sandwich I
haven't used it for that yet I have used it to help with my own writing and Drafting and and and and and those sorts
of tasks um so you know you pointed out that like uh 3D printing didn't kill sculpture you
know hopefully things like Dolly and mid-journey and stable diffusion don't kill graphic art I don't think it's
going to um but certainly there is a lot of consternation over over that those
boundaries right now I think that's kind of probably the more diplomatic way of
saying it um and certainly there's a lot of there's a lot of pain on both sides there's AI artists who are relieved that
they are finally able to express themselves um with with the help of these tools and
then there are um you know other artists that are also kind of facing pain because
um they feel like something's being taken away from them and and certainly there's there's huge disruption
um and I really empathize with with people on both sides I've had uh YouTube comments from people on both both sides
um just expressing like yeah this kind of this kind of sucks so with that I wanted to ask a little bit more you know
what are you what are you worried about you know you mentioned uh certainly like uh new what was it New York City band
chat GPT in schools um so are there anything is there anything else that you're worried about
um and then beyond that what are you excited about for AI in the coming year
um yeah I mean that's basically what I'm wearing is it's like when it comes to the writing side of it
I'm worried about um you know there is an educational element to like crafting an essay about
a topic you learn the topic much better it sort of doesn't matter the point of crafting the essay is not for the essay
to get published somewhere and read by other people when you're in school so when the
function of it is that you become more educated by crafting the piece of writing painstakingly on your own and
students are replacing that with generating it with an AI they're losing an educational element and that's
concerning to me um for sure um in terms of like the flip side of that
and it's like I think I'm excited to continue or for like the creative
side of language models to continue to develop part of my a huge part of my job at copy
AI is that we offer like a creative more creative generation than you might
find from like chat gbt or whatever and more of a variety of approach if you don't like the first generation you can regenerate and get something different
that's like a big part of what we offer um and yeah creativity of approach
variety of approach creativity and human sounding language even if it's maybe a little bit less precise
um and I really just want to like keep keep
exploring that keep seeing that in other places um and I really want people I mean I
touched on this before but I really want the writing world to like Embrace this as a really powerful tool that's because
the the ultimate goal of your writing you haven't come up with it any less in
a way like you're still putting this writing in front of if it's beautiful writing it's beautiful writing
and the purpose of it is the response of the audience
and whether or not the beauty of it was like
partly generated outside the idea for it was partly generated using an ALT like
brain augmentation that you're controlling or like your own brain like you crafted it and it's beautiful and
it's a listing that response in readers and it's a listing that responsible readers because of their Human
Experience so I I don't think there is there's you know
um I'm debating whether I can share something that happened with an open AI model but I don't think I can oh man
I'll I'll come back to it at some point someday I'll share that story but um I'm I'm really excited for that side of AI
to kind of Blossom excellent yeah and obviously if there's
Sharing
something that you're not comfortable sharing no big deal that's fine that's fine
um yeah so like as as a creative myself like I I kind of split the split Two
Worlds I'm on the you know the research side and and the creative side you know I definitely uh feel you there on like
let's embrace it and and while you're speaking something occurred to me like if as a novel novelist if I take my
novel to a a critique group and I get ideas from from a critique group
um and then I take it to an editor it's not a product of strictly my own brain
um same with uh these tools and I'm not saying that like okay you know an editor is is equivalent to getting help from
chat GPT or even having a Ghostwriter right because it's still a human but I but one thing that you focused on was if
it elicits the right response from the from the receiver of that art um is is that like you know that's part
of the goal and we don't have to we don't have to unpack that unless there's any um points that you wanted to to dive
deeper in before we move on to kind of the last section of the of the podcast yeah I think
um just one thing quickly is that for something like visual art um there's
a worry there about I think lots of craft like art versus crap and like but the
craft side of art where people aren't people aren't debating or people are but there's this kind of like well yeah you
came up with the idea for it and whatever but like that's that's only part of it part of it is like
crafting of the object and the skill that goes into that in the artistic sensibility that goes into using that
skill and I can't call in on that because I'm not a visual artist and I
think that's a very but I do think that's a very fair debate to have when it comes to writing that the Divide
between like craft and art is always more nebulous because there isn't like a craft aspect to it writing is very
strange as like sometimes when I I'm like even when I'm asked to read poetry
at a poetry reading sometimes it feels like I'm getting up on stage and being like look how good I can walk and then
like walking back and forth because it's like something that most of us can do and I'm like I can do this even better
and like I can do it in a way that means something and I'm like just reading words off a page that I wrote
um so that divide has always been a bit more nebulous and I think that's part of what makes people nervous about this is
there's like but also why why I think when it comes to augmenting creativity
when it comes to language I actually think it there to me there's less
of a gray area there I I don't feel as like conflicted about it because
you know you're not losing like craft it's like a just a new tool for
something that already was like not quite literal craft anyway
Career Goals
that makes sense and you know the it's not a Perfect Analogy but you know the
the computer didn't destroy education um you know even though it made thing makes things some things easier some
things are a little more convoluted and yeah I do hope that we can adapt to these tools and and think of them as
just more tools extension of the art um so I wanted to the the the final few
questions that I had for you the first one is what do you personally want to achieve like uh you mentioned at the
beginning of the episode that or maybe it was just before we started but you said like you know you never would have thought that you'd be a prompt engineer
so how has AI changed your life in your direction in your career and what do you
want to personally achieve in the coming you know year or two or three
well I'd love to um extend this career and keep keep
doing this um keep like I'd love to be you know one of many people but like
be on the Forefront of like steering where these models are going and what they're
capable of through prompt engineering and prompt optimization and prompt training and stuff and um I think some
people see um you know like the ability of the AI is this and it's ramping up and prompt engineering is like this where like as
we get closer like you know this like prompt engineering is me did less and less and I see it a lot more like that
um so I'm excited to see like if prompt engineering is capable of what it's
capable of right now what will it be capable of 10 years from now and I really want to be part of that
future um I'm not totally sure what that looks like from a career standpoint I'll get
back to you on that yeah absolutely I mean we can we could no more predict Dolly too and then chat
Connect with Anna
GPT than we could anything else so who knows what's going to change within the next 12 months
um but yeah like you I I also want to just stay part of it because whatever's going on it's it's really cool and it
also feels really important um so uh who do you want to get
connected with um is there anyone that you would like to reach out to you on LinkedIn or or
Twitter or however however you want to um engage with the world is there anyone
that you uh want to invite into your professional life or or into your sphere
um come on come all I don't know uh no I um you know I'm interested in connecting
with sort of in the same way that copy I was like unsure whether this was a role that would add value I'm interested in
like thinking about what are other
you know Industries where they don't realize this could add value so if you're like unsure I'd love to like discuss that with you
um if you are one of the other few prompt Engineers out there a few of you we've connected on LinkedIn but like I
feel like it's you know like where there are a handful of us and I would love to get connected with anyone else who
whether that's your official title or not if it's something you do professionally I would love to talk to
you um and then you know also if you're uh
someone who's interested in getting into it especially if you come from a non-tech background but you think it sounds like something that makes sense
for you you have a kind of like I've said this word a bunch now at this point but like an obsessiveness is kind of
important and like really loving language is important
um and more just like loving like semantics and like approach to this thing is important so
um if you're interested in that and if you're interested in AI from like uh
literary or like writing quality standpoint um I'd love to love to get in touch
wonderful wonderful excellent um and uh quick follow-up question where where is best for people to to connect
with you on LinkedIn Twitter probably on LinkedIn yeah okay
um if people are interested I also have I uh I know
um I have a few friends who would like yell at me if I didn't share this so I also have my website uh which has my
writing on it that's been published it's poetry and short stories so it's not totally relevant but that's just my
name.com annabernstein.com but if you want to get in touch about prompt engineering definitely my LinkedIn would
be would be better perfect perfect and um I always like to
wrap up these episodes by just asking um asking my guests what are the what
are the words of wisdom that you want to put out into the world um just any any final any final words
what what is it that you would like the world to know or to hear or to think about
um there's there's something formulating
but it's not quite coming it's something about how like creativity
we don't have to forfeit the realm of creativity as like a particularly human Realm
just because we've created a new tool that helps us with it
I don't know that's really beautiful yeah no that's that's really beautiful and so we'll we'll leave it at that we
do not have to Forfeit the realm of creativity just because we've created a tool
so thank you so much for you yeah yeah
thank you so much for your uh for your time Anna and um I of course wish you
well and as always I really enjoyed um having this time to to speak with you
um and thanks everyone for watching and uh check back in and be good
