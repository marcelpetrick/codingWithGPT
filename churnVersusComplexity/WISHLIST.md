# Wish list - collection of ideas 
* make it possible to filter directories or certain file-types (protobuf-files, ts-files)
* by default analyse the whole git history: not just n commits
* the zoom capability is good. But the majority of the files is still clustered in the bottom-left part, where it becomes unreadable: find a solution
* fix the problem with not-found files: one is the double // path separator for some qml files; the other one: files which were deleted and don't exist anymore: see `Warning: Could not read ../speech4excellence/speech4excellence.py for cognitive complexity: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../speech4excellence/speech4excellence.py'`
