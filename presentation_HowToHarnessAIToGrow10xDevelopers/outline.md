# ideas
* start with intro abut questioning my purpose?
* using chatgpt (4) felt like programming on steroids
* ask the right questions, break the task down into small, well describable chunks -> get useful code
* help to rephrase the functionality works  by giving the error messages
* domain-knowledge is still necessary! not a magical box

* test with estimation: breaking down worked, but the estimations were fantasy values - not usable
* test with development: cool (see above)
* test with helping to find a way to solve an idea at all: cool and working (timeseries with seasonal influence ..)
* test to create unit-tests: worked
* using it to generate test-data (files, etc): works
* test: use it to generate UIs (or code for UIs) - yes, works
* to test: use it for code reviews - detect flaws automatically
* works (more testing needed): conversion of code from one language to another one

## questions
* who is responsible for the output? company, the tool-manufacturer or the developer?
* prevent leakage of our internal code/ideas to tool-manufacturer
* which tools, which integration?
* price versus gains ("The GitHub Copilot for Business subscription is available on a monthly cycle, and is billed at $19 per user per month. Billing for GitHub Copilot for Business is processed at the end of each billing cycle."; "ChatGPT Plus for 20$/month for individuals")
* change management: training for the developers, how to introduce
* can the tools be adapted to our code-bases? is this even necessary?
