## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- `git` installed and configured.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration
1. Create a JSON file named `github_credentials.json` in the script directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "username": "your_github_username",
       "token": "your_personal_access_token"
   }
   ```
   Replace `your_github_username` and `your_personal_access_token` with your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (PAT), respectively.

2. Generating Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Visit [GitHub's token settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
   - Click on `Generate new token`.
   - Give your token a descriptive name, select the scopes or permissions you'd like to grant this token (at minimum, `repo` for accessing private repositories).
   - Click `Generate token` and copy the token immediately. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again!

## Usage
Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python clone_all_repos.py "github_credentials.json"
```
This will clone all the repositories associated with the provided GitHub account into the current directory.
