In the land of code and logic gates,
Where developers craft their fates.
Some lines end with a single space, 
Others have two, keeping pace. 

Bytes and bits in harmony,
A symphony of ones and zeroes, you see. 

Crafting algorithms, weaving dreams,
In the IDE where the cursor gleams.
With every commit, we create,  
A digital world, we do populate. 

From dawn to dusk, we work and play,  
In this realm of code, where we have our say.
