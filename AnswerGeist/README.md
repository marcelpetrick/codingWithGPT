# Answergeist

**Answergeist** is a smart desktop assistant that helps you **analyze questionnaire-style content from a second screen** — fast, intelligently, and with context-aware reasoning.

### ✨ What It Does

- 📸 **Capture on Demand**  
  Press a button to instantly snap a picture of a separate screen — ideal for quizzes, exams, or training content.

- 🔍 **OCR and Text Extraction**  
  Automatically focuses on the central part of the image where questions and answers typically appear.

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Reasoning**  
  Sends the extracted question and answer choices to an AI (OpenAI or local model). For each answer, it returns:
  - A **probability** that it’s correct.
  - A **brief justification** explaining why.

- 🖥️ **Intuitive UI**  
  Each capture appears as a card in a scrollable UI:
  - Left: the screenshot thumbnail  
  - Right: a status spinner (while processing) or results panel with probabilities and explanations

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Trigger**: Click or press hardware input to capture.
2. **OCR**: Extract text from the image center.
3. **Analyze**: Send to AI and get ranked answers.
4. **Review**: See results in a clear, vertical feed of screenshots + insights.

### ⚙️ Configurable

- Choose between **OpenAI API** or **local models** for analysis.
- Optional **result archiving** for long-term review.
