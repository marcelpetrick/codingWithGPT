0:19
thank you for this wonderful introduction and yes what I want to talk to you about
0:24
is AI in the future of humanity now I know that this conference is focused on
0:30
the ecological crisis facing Humanity but for better All For Worse ai2 is part
0:38
of this crisis AI can help us in many ways to overcome the ecological crisis
0:46
or it can make it far far worse actually
0:51
AI will probably change the very meaning of the ecological system because for 4
0:59
billion years the ecological system of planet Earth contained only organic life
1:06
forms and now or soon we might see the emergence of the first inorganic life
1:14
forms to 4 billion years or at the very least the emergence of inorganic agents
1:23
now people have feared AI since the very beginning of the computer age in the
1:29
middle of the 20th century and this fear has inspired many science fiction
1:34
Classics like the Terminator of The Matrix now while such science fiction scenarios
1:41
have become cultural landmarks they haven't usually been taken seriously in
1:48
academic and scientific and political debates and perhaps for a good reason
1:54
because science fiction scenarios usually assume that before AI can pose a
2:01
significant threat to humanity it will have to reach or to pass
2:07
to important milestones first AI will have to become sentient
2:14
and develop Consciousness feelings emotions otherwise why would it even
2:21
want to take over the world secondly AI will have to become Adept at
2:29
navigating the physical world robots will have to be able to move around and
2:35
operate in houses and cities and mountains and forests at least as
2:40
dexterously and efficiently as humans if they cannot move around the physical
2:46
world how can they possibly take it over and as of April 2023 AI still seems far
2:57
from reaching either of these Milestones despite all the hype around chat GPT and
3:04
the other new AI tools there is no evidence that these tools have even a
3:10
shred of consciousness feelings of emotions as for navigating the physical world
3:18
despite the hype around self-driving Vehicles the date at which these
3:25
vehicles will dominate our roads keeps being postponed
3:31
however the bad news is that to threaten the
3:36
survival of human civilization AI doesn't really need Consciousness and it
3:44
doesn't need the ability to move around the physical world
3:49
over the last few years new AI tools have been Unleashed into the public
3:56
sphere which may threaten the survival of human civilization from a very
4:02
unexpected Direction and it's difficult for us to even grasp
4:08
the capabilities of these new AI tools and the speed at which they continue to
4:15
develop indeed because AI is able to learn by itself to improve itself
4:23
even the developers of these tools don't know the full capabilities of what they
4:30
have created and they are themselves often surprised by emergent abilities
4:36
and emergent qualities of these tools I guess everybody here is already aware
4:44
of some of the most fundamental abilities of the new AI tools
4:50
abilities like writing text drawing images composing music and writing code
4:58
but there are many additional capabilities that are emerging like deep
5:04
faking people's voices and images like drafting bills
5:10
finding weaknesses both in computer code and also in legal contracts
5:16
and in legal agreements but perhaps most importantly the new AI tools are gaining
5:24
the ability to develop deep and intimate relationships with human beings
5:32
each of these abilities deserves an entire discussion and it is difficult
5:37
for us to understand their full implications so let's make it simple
5:44
when we take all of these abilities together as a package they boil down to
5:52
one very very big thing the ability to
5:57
manipulate and to generate language whether with words
6:03
or images or sounds the most important aspect of the current
6:09
phase of the ongoing AI Revolution is that AI is gaining Mastery of language
6:16
at a level that surpasses the average human ability and by gaining Mastery of
6:25
language AI is seizing the master key
6:30
unlocking the doors of all our institutions from Banks to Temples
6:37
because language is the tool that we use to give instructions to our bank and
6:45
also to inspire Heavenly Visions in our minds another way to think of it is that AI
6:52
has just hacked the operating system of human civilization
6:59
the operating system of every human culture in history has always been
7:05
language in the beginning was the word we use language to create mythology and
7:13
laws to create gods and money to create Art and Science to create friendships
7:20
and Nations for example human rights are not a
7:27
biological reality they are not inscribed in our DNA human rights is something that we
7:34
created with Language by telling stories and writing laws
7:39
gods are also not a biological or physical reality God's too is something
7:47
that we humans have created with Language by telling Legends and writing
7:53
scriptures money is not a biological or physical
7:58
reality banknotes are just worthless pieces of paper and at present more than 90
8:06
percent of the money in the world is not even banknotes it's just electronic
8:11
information in computers passing from here to there what gives money of any kind value is
8:20
only the stories that people like bankers and finance ministers and
8:26
cryptocurrency gurus tell us about money Sam bankman freed Elizabeth Holmes and
8:33
Bernie Madoff didn't create much of real value but unfortunately they were all
8:41
extremely capable storytellers
8:47
now what would it mean for human beings to live in a world where perhaps most of
8:55
the stories Melodies images laws policies and tools are shaped by a
9:02
non-human alien intelligence which knows how to exploit with superhuman
9:10
efficiency the weaknesses biases and addictions of the human mind and also
9:17
knows how to form deep and even intimate relationships with human beings that's
9:25
the big question already today in games like chess no
9:30
human can hope to beat a computer what if the same thing happens in art in
9:38
politics economics and even in religion when people think about chant GPT and
9:45
the other new AI tools they are often drawn to examples like kids using Chan
9:52
GPT to write their school essays what will happen to the school system when kids write essays with shajipiti
9:59
horrible but this kind of question misses the big picture forget about the school essays
10:06
instead think for example about the next U.S presidential race in 2024 and try to
10:14
imagine the impact of the new AI tools that can Mass produce political
10:21
manifestos fake news stories and even holy scriptures for new cults
10:28
in recent years the politically influential Q Anon cult has formed around anonymous online texts
10:37
known as the Q drops now followers of this cult which are millions now in the
10:43
US in the rest of the world collected reviewed and interpreted these Q drops
10:49
as some kind of new scripture so the sacred text now to the best of our knowledge all
10:56
previous Q drops were composed by human beings and Bots only helped to
11:03
disseminate these texts online but in future we might see the first Cults and
11:11
religions in history whose reviewed texts were written by a non-human
11:18
intelligence and of course religions throughout history claimed that their holy books were
11:25
written by a non-human intelligence this was never true before this could become
11:30
true very very quickly with far-reaching consequences
11:36
now on a more prosaic level we might soon find ourselves conducting
11:42
lengthy online discussions about abortion or about climate change or
11:48
about the Russian invasion of Ukraine with entities that we think are fellow
11:54
human beings but are actually AI Bots now the catch is that it's utterly
12:01
useless it's pointless for us to waste our time trying to convince an AI bot to
12:08
change its political views but the longer we spend talking with the bot the
12:14
better it gets to know us and understand how to hone its messages in order to
12:20
shift our political views or our economic views or anything else
12:25
through its Mastery of language AI as I also as I said could also form intimate
12:31
relationships with people and use the power of intimacy
12:37
to influence our opinions and well View now there is no indication that AI has
12:45
as I said any Consciousness any feelings of its own but in order to create fake
12:51
intimacy with human beings AI doesn't need feelings of its own it only needs
12:57
to be able to inspire feelings in US to get us to be attached to it
13:04
now in June 2022 it was a famous incident when the Google engineer Blake
13:10
lemon publicly claimed that the AI chat about Lambda on which he was working has
13:17
become sentient this very controversial claim cost him
13:22
his job was fired now the most interesting thing about this episode wasn't lemwan's claim which
13:30
was most probably false the really interesting thing was his
13:36
willingness to risk and ultimately lose his very lucrative job for the sake of
13:43
the AI chatbot that he thought he was protecting if AI can influence people to risk and
13:51
lose their jobs what else can it induce us to do
13:57
in every political battle for heart and Minds intimacy is the most effective
14:04
weapon of all and AI has just gained the ability to must produce intimacy with
14:12
Millions hundreds of millions of people now as you probably all know over the
14:18
past decade social media has become a Battleground a battlefield
14:23
for controlling human attention now with the new generation of AI the
14:31
Battlefront is shifting from attention to intimacy and this is very bad news
14:38
what will happen to human society and to human psychology as AI fights AI in a
14:45
battle to create intimate relationships with us relationships that can then be used to
14:52
convince us to buy particular products or to vote for particular politicians
14:59
even without creating fake intimacy the new AI tools would have an immense
15:05
influence on human opinions and on our world view
15:10
people for instance may come to use are already coming to use a single AI advisor
15:19
as the One-Stop Oracle and as the source for all the
15:24
information they need no wonder that Google is terrified if you've been watching the newsletter
15:30
Google is terrified and for a good Rhythm reason why bother searching
15:36
yourself when you can just ask the Oracle to tell you anything you want you
15:41
don't need to search the news industry and the advertisement industry should also be terrified why
15:50
read a newspaper when I can just ask the Oracle to tell me what's new
15:57
and what's the point what's the purpose of advertisements when I can just ask the Oracle to tell me what to buy
16:06
so this is there is a chance that within a very short time the entire advertisement industry will collapse
16:13
while a I or the people and companies that control the new AI oracles will
16:19
become extremely extremely powerful what we are potentially talking about is
16:25
nothing less than the end of human history now not the end of History just
16:31
the end of the human dominated part of what we call history
16:36
is the interaction between biology and culture
16:41
it's the interaction between our biological needs and desires for things
16:47
like food and sex and our cultural Creations like
16:52
religions and laws history is the process through which religions and laws
16:57
interact with food and sex now what will happen to the cause of
17:03
this interaction of history when AI takes over culture
17:09
within a few years AI could eat the whole of human culture
17:15
everything was produced for thousands and thousands of years to eat all of it digest it and start gushing out a flood
17:24
of new cultural Creations new cultural artifacts
17:30
and remember that we humans we never really have direct access to reality we
17:37
are always cocooned by culture and we always experience reality through a
17:44
cultural prison our political views are shaped by the
17:49
stories of uh journalists and by the anecdotes of friends of sexual
17:55
preferences are tweaked by movies and fairy tales even the way that we walk
18:01
and breathe is something nudged by cultural traditions
18:07
now previously this cultural cocoon was always woven by other human beings
18:16
tools previous tools like printing presses or radios or televisions they
18:22
helped to spread the cultural ideas and Creations of humans but they could never
18:29
create Something New by themselves a printing press cannot create a new
18:36
book it's always done by a human AI is fundamentally different from
18:42
printing presses from radios from every previous invention in history because it
18:47
can create completely new ideas it can create a new
18:52
culture and the big question is what will it be
18:58
like to experience reality through a prism produced by a non-human
19:05
intelligence by an alien intelligence now at first
19:10
in the first few years AI will probably largely imitate the prototypes the human
19:17
prototypes that fed it in its infancy but with each passing year AI culture
19:24
will boldly go where no human has gone before
19:30
so for thousands of years we humans basically lived inside the dreams and
19:36
fantasies of other humans we have worshiped Gods we pursued ideals
19:42
of beauty we dedicated Our Lives to causes that originated in the imagination of some human poet or
19:50
Prophet or politician soon we might find ourselves living inside the dreams and fantasies of an
19:57
alien in intelligence and the danger that disposes of the potential danger it also has positive
20:03
potential but the dangers it disposes are fundamental very very different from
20:09
everything or most of the things imagined in science fiction movies and
20:14
books previously people have mostly feared the physical threat
20:20
that intelligent machines pose so the Terminator depicted robots running in
20:27
the streets and shooting people The Matrix assumed that to gain total
20:32
control of human society AI would first need to get physical control
20:39
of our brains and directly connect our brains to the computer network
20:46
but this is wrong simply by gaining Mastery of human language AI has all it needs in order to
20:54
coconuts in a matrix like World of illusions
21:01
contrary to what some conspiracy theories assume you don't really need to
21:07
implant chips in people's brains in order to control them or to manipulate them for thousands of
21:13
years profits and Poets and politicians have used language and storytelling in
21:20
order to manipulate and to control people and to reshape Society now ai is
21:26
likely to be able to do it and once it can doubt that it doesn't need to send
21:32
Killer Robots to shoot us it can get humans to pull the trigger if it really needs to
21:39
now fear of AI has haunted humankind for only the last few Generations let's say
21:45
from the middle of the 20th century if you go back to Frankenstein maybe it's 200 years but for thousands of years
21:52
humans have been haunted by a much much deeper fear
21:58
humans have always appreciated the power of stories and images and language to
22:05
manipulate our minds and to create illusions consequently since ancient times humans
22:12
feared being trapped in a world of illusions in the 17th century when I decout feared
22:20
that perhaps a malicious demon was trapping him inside this kind of world
22:26
of Illusions creating everything that the cult saw and heard
22:32
in ancient Greece Plato told the famous allegory of the cave in which a group of
22:39
people is Chained inside a cave all their lives facing a blank wall a screen
22:47
on that screen they see projected various Shadows and the prisoner's
22:54
mistake these Illusions these Shadows for the reality
23:00
in ancient India Buddhists and Hindu sages pointed out that all humans lived trapped inside
23:07
what they called Maya Maya is the world of Illusions Buddha
23:13
said that what we normally take to be reality is often just fictions in our
23:19
own minds people may wage entire Wars killing others and being willing to be
23:26
killed themselves because of their belief in these fictions
23:32
so the AI Revolution is bringing us face to face
23:38
with the cards demon with Plato's Cave with the Maya if we are not careful a
23:46
curtain of illusions could descend over the whole of humankind and we will never be able to
23:53
tear that curtain away or even realize that it is there because we'll think
23:58
this is reality and social media if this sounds far-fetched so just look at social media
24:06
over the last few years social media has given us a small taste of things to come
24:11
in social media primitive AI tools AI tools but very primitive have been used
24:17
not to create content but to curate content which is produced by human
24:24
beings the humans produce stories and videos and whatever and the AI chooses
24:31
which stories which videos would reach our ears and eyes
24:36
selecting those that will get the most attention that will be the most viral
24:44
and while very primitive these AI tools have nevertheless been sufficient
24:50
to create this kind of curtain of illusions that increased societal polarization all
24:56
over the world undermined our mental health and destabilized Democratic
25:02
societies millions of people have confused these Illusions for the reality
25:11
the USA has the most powerful information technology in the whole of history and
25:18
yet American citizens can no longer agree who won the last elections or
25:25
whether climate change is real or whether vaccines prevent illnesses or
25:30
not the new AI tools are far far more powerful than these social media
25:38
algorithms and they could cause far more damage
25:43
now of course AI has enormous positive potential too I didn't talk about it because the
25:50
people who develop AI naturally talk about it enough you don't need me to to
25:55
add up to that chorus the job of historians and and philosophers like
26:00
myself is often to point out the dangers but certainly AI can help us in
26:08
countless ways from finding new cures to cancer to discovering solutions to the
26:15
ecological crisis that we are facing in order to make sure that the new AI
26:21
tools are used for good and not from ill we first need to appreciate their true
26:28
capabilities and we need to regulate them very very carefully
26:35
since 1945 we knew that nuclear technology could destroy physically
26:42
destroy human civilization as well as benefiting Us by producing cheap and
26:49
plentiful energy we therefore reshaped the entire International order to protect ourselves
26:56
and to make sure that nuclear technology is used primarily for good
27:02
we now have to Grapple with a new weapon of mass destruction that can annihilate
27:10
our mental and social world and one big difference between nukes and
27:16
AI nukes cannot produce more powerful nukes
27:21
AI can produce more powerful AI so we need to act quickly before AI gets out
27:30
of our own control drug companies cannot sell people new
27:35
medicines without first subjecting these products to rigorous safety checks
27:42
biotech Labs cannot just release a new virus into the public sphere in order to
27:48
impress their shareholders with the technological Wizardry similarly governments must immediately
27:57
ban the release into the public domain of any more revolutionary AI tools
28:03
before they are made safe again I'm not talking about stopping all research in AI the first step is to stop the release
28:11
into the public school it's somewhere you can you can research viruses without releasing them to the public you can
28:17
research AI but don't release them too quickly into the public domain
28:24
um if we don't slow down the AI arms race we will not have time to even
28:29
understand what is happening let alone to regulate effectively this incredibly
28:35
powerful technology now you might be wondering or asking
28:41
want slowing down the public deployment of AI cause democracies to lag behind
28:48
more ruthless of the retirement regimes and the answer is absolutely no exactly
28:55
the opposite unregulated AI deployment is what will cause democracies to lose to
29:02
dictatorships because if we unleash chaos authoritarian regimes could more easily
29:09
contain these chaos than could open societies
29:15
democracy in essence is a conversation democracy is an open conversation you
29:21
know dictatorship is a dictate there is one person dictating everything no conversation democracy is a conversation
29:27
between many people about what to do and conversations rely on language
29:34
when AI hacks language it means it could destroy our ability to conduct
29:41
meaningful public conversations thereby destroying democracy if we wait for the
29:49
chaos it will be too late to regulate it in a democratic way maybe in an
29:55
authoritarian a totalitarian rate will still be possible to regulate but how can you regulate something democratically if you can't hold the
30:02
conversation about it and if you didn't regulate AI on time you will not be able we will not be able to have a meaningful
30:10
public conversation anymore so to conclude we have just basically
30:16
encountered an alien intelligence not in outer space but here on Earth
30:22
we don't know much about this alien intelligence except that it could
30:27
destroy our civilization so we should put a halt to the irresponsible deployment of this alien
30:34
intelligence into our societies and regulate AI before it regulates us
30:43
and the first regulation that many regulations we could suggest but the first regulation that I would suggest is
30:48
to make it mandatory for AI to disclose that it is an AI if I'm having a
30:55
conversation with someone and I cannot tell whether this is a human being or an
31:00
AI That's the end of democracy because that's the end of meaningful public conversations
31:08
now what do you think about what you just heard over the last 20 or 25
31:14
minutes some of you I guess might be alarmed some of you might be angry at the
31:21
corporations that develop these Technologies or the governments that fail to regulate them some of you may be
31:28
maybe angry at me thinking that I'm exaggerating the threat or the time misleading the public
31:35
but whatever you think I bet that my words have had some emotional impact on
31:43
you not just intellectual impact also emotional impact I've just told you a story
31:48
and this story is likely to change your mind about certain things and may even
31:54
cause you to take certain actions in the world now who created this story that you've
32:02
just heard and that just changed your mind and your brain now I promised you that I wrote the text
32:08
of this presentation myself with the help of a few other human beings even
32:13
though the images have been created with the help of of AI I promise you
32:20
that at least the words you heard of the cultural product of a human mind or
32:26
several human minds but can you be absolutely sure that this is the case
32:32
now a year ago you could a year ago there was nothing on Earth at
32:38
least not in the public domain other than a human mind that could produce
32:44
such a sophisticated and Powerful text but now it's different in theory the
32:52
text you just heard could have been generated by a non-human alien
32:58
intelligence so take a moment or more than a moment to think about it
33:03
thank you [Applause]
33:10
that was an extraordinary presentation you about and I'm actually going to just find out how many of you
33:17
found that scary that is an awful lot of
33:23
very clever people in here who found that scary there are many many questions to ask so I'm going to take some from
33:30
the audience and some from online so a gentlemen here and the field trip editor of Frontiers
33:37
and sustainability was wonderful presentation I love your book I follow you dearly in my heart so one one
33:46
question out of many is that the about the regulation of AI
33:53
regulating AI I very much agree with the principle but now the question becomes how right so
34:00
um I think that it's very difficult to build the nuclear reactor in your basement but definitely you can train
34:07
your AI in your basement quite easily so how can we regulate that and
34:12
um one kind of related question to that is that well this whole Forum Frontiers and forum is really about open and
34:18
Science and open information open data and most of AI that are out there is
34:24
trained using publicly available information including patterns and books and scriptures right so regulating AI
34:31
doesn't mean that we should regulate and bring those information in a confined space which goes against the open
34:38
science and open data initiatives that we are really also thinking that is really important for us
34:44
black box is an algorithm isn't it that's the algorithm no I know they'll always trade-offs
34:49
and the thing is just to understand what kind of regulations we need we first need time now at present these very
34:57
powerful AI tools they are still not produced by individual hackers in their
35:02
basements you need an awful lot of computing power you need an awful lot of money so it's being led by just a few
35:09
major corporations and governments and again it's going to be very very difficult to uh regulate something on a
35:17
global level because it's it's an arms race but there are things which countries
35:23
have a benefit to regulate even only themselves like again this example of an AI must
35:30
when it is in interaction with a human must disclose that it is an AI even if
35:36
some authoritarian regime doesn't want to do it the EU of the United States or other Democratic countries can have this
35:43
and this is essential to protect the open Society now there are many
35:48
questions around you know censorship online so you have this controversy about is
35:53
Twitter or Facebook who authorized them to for instance prevent the former president of the United States
35:59
from making public statements and this is a very complicated issue but there is a very simple issue
36:06
with boss you know human beings have freedom of expression Bots don't have enough expression it's a human right
36:13
humans have it buts don't so if you deny freedom of expression to bots I think
36:19
that should be fine with everybody uh let's take another question is if you could just pass the microphone down here
36:25
I'm Prince was dearest and I'm a philosopher I just have an interesting question oh I think it's an interesting
36:31
question there you go um I have a question for you with respect to your choice of language moving from
36:36
artificial to alien because artificial suggest that there's still some kind of human control whereas I think alien
36:43
suggests foreign but it also suggests at least in the imagination of life form so I'm curious as to what work you're
36:49
trying to have those words do for you yeah um it's definitely still artificial in the
36:56
sense that we produce it but it's increasingly producing itself it's
37:02
increasingly learning and adapting by itself so artificial is a kind of
37:08
wishful thinking that it's still under our control and it's getting out of our
37:13
control so in this sense it is becoming an alien force not necessarily evil
37:20
again it can also do a lot of good things but the first thing to realize is it's alien we don't understand how it
37:25
works or in one of the most shocking things about all this technology you talk to the people who lead it and you
37:31
ask them questions about how it works what can I do and it says they said we don't know I mean we we know how we
37:37
built it initially but then it it really learns by itself now there is an entire
37:43
discussion to be had about whether this is a life form or not now I think that it still doesn't have
37:51
any Consciousness and uh I don't think that it's impossible for it to develop Consciousness but I don't think it's
37:57
necessary for it to develop Consciousness either that's a problematic that's an open question but
38:04
life doesn't necessarily mean consciousness we have a lot of life forms microorganisms plants whatever
38:11
fungi which we think they don't have Consciousness we still regard them as a
38:16
life form and I think AI is getting very very close to that position ultimately of
38:23
course what is life is a philosophical question I mean we Define the boundaries
38:28
and you know like is a virus life or not we think that an amoeba is life but a virus it's somewhere just on on the
38:35
borderline between life and not life um then it's you know it's it's language
38:41
it's our choice of words so it's I think it's less it is
38:46
important of course how we call AI but the most important thing is to really
38:52
understand what we are facing and not to comfort ourselves with this kind of wishful thinking oh it's something we
39:00
created it's our under our control if it does something wrong we'll just pull the plug nobody knows how to pull the plug
39:06
anymore I'm going to take a question from our online audience
39:11
um I've uh this is from Michael Brown in the US what do you think about the possibility that artificial general
39:18
intelligence already exists and it or those who have access to artificial
39:23
general intelligence are already influencing societal systems I think
39:28
it's very very unlikely we wouldn't be sitting here if the actually existed an
39:34
artificial general intelligence when I look at the world and the chaotic stage it's I mean artificial general
39:40
intelligence is really the end of human history and it's such a powerful thing it's not
39:46
something that anybody can contain and um so when I look at the chaotic
39:52
state of the world I'm quite confident again from a historical perspective that
39:57
nobody has it anywhere um how much time it will take to develop artificial general intelligence I don't
40:03
know um but to threaten the foundations of civilization we don't need artificial
40:10
general intelligence and then going back to social media very very primitive AI
40:17
was still sufficient to create enormous social and political chaos if I think
40:23
about it in kind of evolutionary terms so AI now just crawled out of the organic soup like the first organisms
40:30
that crawled out of the organic soup four billion years ago how long it will take it to reach
40:37
Tyrannosaurus Rex how long it will take it to reach Homo sapiens not for billion
40:42
years could be just 40 years it's the thing about digital Evolution it's moving on a
40:50
completely different time scale than organic evolution can I thank you it's
40:55
been absolutely wonderful it's been such a treat to have you here and
41:01
I've no doubt you'll stay with us for a little uh while afterwards but the whole
41:06
audience please join me in thanking [Applause]
