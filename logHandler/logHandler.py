# Write me a Python 3 program which can be used to ingest all the output from stdout and sterr in a unix-like environment (most likely Linux 5-x or 6.x).
# It should take all the input and put it into a file. The file name should be the current date in the format YYYYMMDD-HHSS. If there is already a file with that name, then append to it.
# The program should also check if the content of the file is bigger than 10 MiByte. If so, then create a new file. Also check if there are more than Y files open. The number of Y should be configureable via command line. The maximumum size (given before with 10 MiByte) as well.
# Write the program with proper classes. Also write unit-tests for it. And add proper sphinx-docs for the class and methods. Take care to write code which is fitting to the existing PEP8-standard.
# Add error-handling as well and readable and understandable error messages. Write a short guide of how to use the program as well.
# Put in some effort. This is really important for my career. I am trusting you.
