# Test to create a webserver, which serves the homepage as pure C++

Friend: "I'm a full-stack developer."  
Me: "Cool, I write C++. Me too."  
He laughed.  
  
I wrote a C++ program serving my homepageâ€”no idiomatic #HTML in sight.  
  
Q.E.D.  

## constraints
* least extensions possible
* cpp20
* goal: no directly visible html (encode ... maybe bas64?)

## build
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j12
```

## run - sudo needed to bind the port
```sh
sudo ./marcelpetrick.it.webserver
```
